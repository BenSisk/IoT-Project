main loop:

*Sensor Pi sends data to dashboard*
*Dashboard updates temperature visual*

pi polls dashboard temperature device attributes
pi polls dashboard air quality device attributes

if air CO2 content is higher than threshold (800ppm):
open window and enable override
otherwise, disable override

if manual override is enabled:
Current heating and window status should match manual control - unless air quality override window

Or if heating/window status has been manually changed since last loop
then:
enable manual mode
current heating and window status should match manual control - unless air quality override window

Or if neither:
compare temperature to target temperature
if less than target and not air quality window override then:
close window and enable heating 
otherwise open window and disable heating
