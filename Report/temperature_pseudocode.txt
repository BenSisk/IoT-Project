main loop:

*Sensor Pi sends data to dashboard*
*Dashboard updates temperature visual*

pi polls dashboard temperature device attributes
pi polls dashboard air quality device attributes

if air CO2 content is higher than threshold (800ppm):
	open window and enable override
otherwise:
	disable override

if manual override is enabled then:
	Current heating and window status = manual control status - unless air quality override window

Or if heating/window status has been manually changed since last loop then:
	enable manual mode
	Current heating and window status = manual control status - unless air quality override window

Or if neither and not air quality window override then:
	compare temperature to target temperature
	if less than target then:
		close window and enable heating 
	else:
		open window and disable heating
